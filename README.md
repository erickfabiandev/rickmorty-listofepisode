## Overview :writing_hand:
This project is a high-quality web application that makes API requests using axios and utilizes the Promise.all parallelism principle for efficient data retrieval. The application presents a list of episodes with a polished and responsive user interface built with React, styled using SASS, and adorned with delightful icons from React Icons. Its adaptive design ensures an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

### Installation :gear:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/erickfabiandev/rickmorty-listofepisode.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd rickmorty-listofepisode
 ```
3. To ensure the proper functioning of the application, you need to configure environment variables. Duplicate the .env.example file in the root directory, rename it to .env, and fill in the required API details:
```shell
 VITE_APIVITE_API_BASE_URL= 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api'
  ```
4. Install the dependencies: 
```shell
 npm install
 ```
5. Start the application: 
```shell
 npm run dev
  ```
The application will automatically open in your default web browser, ready for exploration.

### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:
The challenge was to create a web application that could get data from an API using the Promise.all parallelism principle in combination with axios and display a list of episodes. It required implementing custom styles with SASS and adding support for icons using React Icons. In addition, the application had to be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
